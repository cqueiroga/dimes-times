Web development project for Dimes Times

This was a web development project in school. I decided to make a site for a friend who needed a website but it never went live.
He decided to go a different route using a CMS, so he was able to make changes easier since he didn't know how to update the
content.

The project was used again later on to make the site mobile responsive. I learned how to use media queries for desktops, tablets
and mobile devices. When the project was first created one of the requirements was to use tables. This got tricky when making
the site mobile responsive but was eventually completed.
